- 👋 Hi, I’m @vwarrier-afk, a Salesforce developer with over 5 years of experience. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about Salesforce and its applications as a platform. I am currently catching up with Lightning Web Components and I'm really excited
to see what I can accomplish with it. I'm also interested in learning more about various branches of Data Science - I get off on a good visualisation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript not just because of how important it is for LWC development, but also because how it is constantly evolving with new libraries and also
how widespread its applications are, not to mention how powerful it is in a myriad of domains, from UI to Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solutions in technology that have the power to impact people positively.
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop me a message on Twitter @vivekwarrier or DM me on Instagram @thevivekwarrier. LinkedIn is almost always running at the background on my phone, so you 
can reach out to me there as well at https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivekwarrier.
